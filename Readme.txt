Practical implementation on Linear Regression Analysis

OBJECTIVE:

To estimate house prices by plotting fitted regression curve on the scatter plot of given data set. Once the fitted regression line is known, the fitted value of corresponding to any observed data point can be calculated.

DATA:

The Real Estate Valuation Dataset used in this project is included as real_estate.csv.
Five features (X1 to X5) has been taken as parameters. And the actual Value of House prices is taken as Y.

X1 - house age
X2 - distance to the nearest MRT station
X3 - number of convenience stores
X4 - latitude
X5 - longitude

INSTALL:

This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed :-

> NumPy
command prompt: pip install numpy

> Pandas
command prompt: pip install pandas

> Matplotlib
command prompt: pip install matplotlib

> Jupyter Notebook
command prompt: pip install jupyter

If Python is not installed yet, Anaconda distribution of Python can also be used, which already has the above packages.

OUTPUT:

> The actual Y values and predicted values using each feature has been plotted
> Error obtained for each feature is shown table wise
> Computed Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error
